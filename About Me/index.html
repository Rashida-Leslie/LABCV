        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         
As an emerging architectural professional pursuing my Master of Architecture at Carleton University, I bring a perspective shaped by experiences across multiple urban environments. 
My work centers on the critical intersection of architecture and urbanism, with a particular focus on human-scaled design and ethical interventions.
 At A & Architects, I've translated this philosophy into practical experience, developing construction documents while maintaining sensitivity to site context and user needs.
</p>
My approach to architecture is deeply rooted in thorough site research and gap analysis, skills I've honed through both professional work and mentorship initiatives. Through programs like Black Students in Design and Building Black Success Through Design, I've demonstrated my commitment to making architecture more accessible and responsive to diverse community needs. This experience in breaking down complex architectural concepts for various audiences aligns well with digital storytelling and public engagement initiatives.
</p>
Currently developing my professional French proficiency, I work at the intersection of technical precision and cultural understanding. My background spans from detailed technical documentation to collaborative community engagement, positioning me to contribute meaningfully to multidisciplinary projects that bridge architectural innovation with public narrative. I'm particularly excited about leveraging emerging digital technologies to enhance how we communicate and preserve architectural stories while ensuring they remain grounded in human experience and ethical considerations.
